# CSS Flower Art

## Motivation
CSS is rough! I'm constantly trying to get better at it. I've seen a couple "pure css" artworks roaming around the internet and was so impressed. I'm much less artistic than the creators of most of this art, but I still wanted to try it out. 

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript.

## Features
I started out writing this in pure css, and it still is 90% CSS, but I got annoyed with creating a bunch of divs and decided to switch to using React.

## Stack
* CSS
* React.js
